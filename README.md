# ListWish
ListWish is a wish list/price tracker app in Ruby on Rails, created as part of the CodeLabs Ruby on Rails backend curriculum.

The original plan was to connect to an API (or more likely multiple APIs) to track product prices on Amazon, Best Buy, etc. using the [Faraday gem](https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/) to connect with and manage multiple APIs.
Unfortunately, these retailers do not offer a free product API, so the app was initialized with fake products. May update this later on.

Users will be able to create a Wish List of favorite items and keep track of the prices of those items.
Possibly will integrate notifications for users when prices of items change by a certain amount.
