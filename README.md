# ListWish
Creating a wish list/price tracker app in Ruby on Rails as part of the CodeLabs Ruby on Rails backend curriculum.

Initializing the app with dummy data for now, with plans to connect to an API (or more likely multiple APIs) to track product prices on Amazon, Best Buy, etc.
Planning to use the [Faraday gem](https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/) to connect with and manage multiple APIs.

Users will be able to create a Wish List of favorite items and keep track of the prices of those items.
Possibly will integrate notifications for users when prices of items change by a certain amount.
